        <p>Nigeria is a country in West Africa, bordered by Benin, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. It is the most populous country in
        Africa, with over 220 million people, and has a diverse mix of ethnic groups and languages, with English as the official
        language. Nigeria is rich in natural resources, especially oil and gas, which are major drivers of its economy. Its
        largest city is Lagos, a major financial and cultural hub, while Abuja is the capital. Despite its economic potential,
        Nigeria faces challenges such as political instability, corruption, and regional insecurity.
